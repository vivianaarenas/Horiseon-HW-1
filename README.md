# Horiseon-HW-1

For this assignment, I refacted code on a webpage to ensure that it meets accessibility standards. In the code, you should find, semantic HTML elements, outline and structure that elements follow for position and styling, image elements and appopriate alt attributes, and concise, descriptive comments throughout the HTML.

I don't know why my screenshot images look like that, but I gave it all I got, and that's all I got.

Thank you.
